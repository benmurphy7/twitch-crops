# twitch-crops
Analyzing emote usage in Twitch stream recordings.

Work in progress...

The main idea of this project is to find segments of stream videos that envoked a strong reaction from the audience - quantified by the use of Twitch emotes. The starting point is to track and visualize emote usage over time. This data can then be used to automatically crop videos into a collection of shorter clips, highlighting periods of stronger engagement. This could become a useful tool for viewers, providing a way to watch the best moments from a longer broadcast without the employment of an editor.
