[2:45:05] <+PublicEnemy1010> @Primarryy yeah for sure I love most of his community but some people ruin it as always
[2:45:05] <%MacaMaca> sucking lud dry i see
[2:45:06] <ItsApoIIo_> tweet it for sure
[2:45:07] <@Primarryy> I feel that, but you need to promote it because it's something special
[2:45:09] <+pizzarolIs> tweet it
[2:45:12] <%samantwan> alright guys i’m out, goodnight everyone. thanks for the stream rizz!
[2:45:12] <VENPIN> https://www.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/407734-KEKW

[2:45:20] <agro6996> no one would mind i think
[2:45:24] <@Primarryy> PublicEnemy1010 It happens with every community, I see it around here as well. shit happens
[2:45:35] <+phxs2> Nah go for it he thought the same thing

[2:45:36] <%moranv2> rizz subbed earlier, just wanted to thank you for the content both youtube and twitch, big fan (240lbs)
[2:45:36] <TheZachle> btw to play the midi file you have to use the console
[2:45:48] <SodaaPlanet> someone @me whats going on with him and Ludwig been a fan of both for awhile and idk why they are mixing content
[2:45:50] <+PublicEnemy1010> @Primarryy yeah ofc nothing you can do but ban them and move on
[2:45:52] <MaelstromDrift> Yo totally tweet about it. It's a cool for both of you. Love Rocket League and love Ludwig and I doubt anyone can be mad about you advertising it
[2:45:53] <&Sintilla> the term leech sucks lol
[2:45:59] <$YaKeeBaes> @Rizzo you callin me a normie? Sadge
[2:46:00] <@Primarryy> !ludwig @SodaaPlanet
[2:46:01] <@Nightbot> Rizzo will be playing against Ludwig, Atrioc, and Stanz on Friday night 1/22 in a 3v1 Rocket League match

[2:46:32] <&Sintilla> ive seen so many amazing collabs because of rust too!
[2:46:36] <+ImaginarySox> @moranv2 LULW
[2:46:38] <VladDern> We may come from Lud but we also love it
[2:46:39] <@Primarryy> It's just people that say that and make it seem like they are leeching
[2:46:40] <+phxs2> Just hit plat tho
[2:46:49] <Smelling> just got this stream in my recommended, i really need to get off twitch... @Rizzo
[2:46:50] <+iMinify> I’ve been watching since the neatmike and rob days
[2:46:50] <@Primarryy> especially with among us where you see massive creators play with much smaller ones
[2:46:52] <+PublicEnemy1010> @Primarryy ludwig7 have a good stream and night man, good talking to you
[2:47:01] <ttvkiller_uhhhh> yo dis its not rocket league
[2:47:01] <%moranv2> @ImaginarySox KEKW

[2:47:05] <@Primarryy> PublicEnemy1010 thank you man! Have a good night aswell ludwig7
[2:47:10] <RyleTV> you were talking about how lots of small creators dont talk to big creators
[2:47:14] <VENPIN> yeah it's great to see all these creators collaborating FeelsStrongMan
[2:47:22] <&Sintilla> people who use the term leech unironically are weird imo
[2:47:25] <%youngkurisu> Goodnight everyone, i gotta hit the sack
[2:47:39] <ckev> Yo I g ot the insane idea bro imma hit you up later
[2:47:39] <rxst___> !uptime
[2:47:39] <@Nightbot> Stream uptime: 2 hours 47 minutes 58 seconds
[2:47:41] <ItsApoIIo_> i remember watching you and sizz for forever so it's great to see the colab
[2:47:41] <d7oom_yq> whos lud
[2:47:42] <+AestheticV3> I got 1100 hours in rocket league. still diamond 2. I have gotten better but so has everyone else. frustrating.
[2:47:43] <TheZachle> I watched so much f2 back in the days rip neatmike
[2:47:46] <%The_Fatal_Banana> Its just another form of networking. Thats how you grow a solid community too.
[2:47:51] <@Primarryy> you should 1000% percent make it public, I already dm'ed you about making it as hype as a jake paul boxing match LULW
[2:47:52] <+snaxgz> Hello Glizzzo
[2:47:53] <%MacaMaca> the depths monkaW
[2:47:54] <&Sintilla> @The_Fatal_Banana exactly
[2:48:05] <%Ultro43> OMEGALUL Perfect
[2:48:09] <MaelstromDrift> A great example of not giving a fuck is ConnorEatsPants. He aggressively looks to push for collabs and help and it's almost never a negative experience for viewers.
[2:48:10] <agro6996> Are you doing some sort of challenge in the 3v1? like no boost or jump or smtn?
[2:48:15] <%Ch04yo> POg
[2:48:16] <d7oom_yq> who is lud
[2:48:17] <%The_Fatal_Banana> Positives for both parties

[2:52:31] <VladDern> Rizzo is really good
[2:52:33] <TurtIezG> @Primarryy YEP
[2:52:35] <@Primarryy> just want an opinion
[2:52:40] <&Sintilla> @oznie its the place to be apparently! hahaha its really nice, i like it a lot. plus houses are cheap af compared to socal
[2:52:46] <@Primarryy> espcially after a raid from a streamer that only uses LULW
[2:52:46] <%Rowanbangsund> you and lud are my two favourite people to watch right now so I'm super excited for this
[2:52:57] <@Primarryy> VENPIN thats evil LULW
[2:53:04] <%navetw> coinflip to remove KEKW sounds like the move
[2:53:07] <%Ultro43> What does LULW sound like, I only know how KEKW sounds.
[2:53:07] <MaelstromDrift> Nothing more fun for viewers than a story line for a challenge. You tweeting about it can only help both sides.
[2:53:08] <%Rowanbangsund> LULW is superiour
[2:53:10] <@Primarryy> were catching up with the alerts LUL
[2:53:11] <+iMinify> Lud farms LULW’s

[2:54:16] <@Nightbot> http://prntscr.com/nylcal
[2:54:18] <+PublicEnemy1010> Lud probably has veiwer overlap with anyone he talks to bc he's so funny and charismatic, he just draws people in
[2:54:21] <%Its_Me_Neeks> Scrap the tech trash you’ll get more scrap from them
[2:54:26] <agro6996> good taste
[2:54:26] <adonis__gaming> hows it going rizz
[2:54:35] <agro6996> SeemsGood SeemsGood
[2:54:36] <+TvDelta> This literally just looks like 7 days to die
[2:54:40] <@Primarryy> Although I am subbed to lud on twitch. I rarely catch his streams. But I watch every single youtube video LULW
[2:54:41] <%acr10> Ive subbed for 2 months and have only typed in chat like twice
[2:54:43] <%Rowanbangsund> I started watching you after free to play and been watching lud for over a year so it's really cool to see you guys collab
[2:54:44] <$AyayronYoo> No dont remove it FeelsBadMan
[2:54:47] <@Primarryy> watch me @Rizzo
[2:54:49] <%moranv2> KEKW ?
[2:54:51] <bk1rk> You guys have a similar energy and sense of humor I think. At least more than other rl ppl
[2:54:52] <@Primarryy> wanna bet
[2:54:54] <&Sintilla> @MacaMaca hell yeah! so many streamers live in texas. no income tax ayyyy
[2:54:55] <VENPIN> do it :)
[2:54:55] <+Kelpo_RL> you should try rocket league sometime i feel like u would be decent
[2:54:56] <%MacaMaca> same Primarryy
[2:55:07] <KendineWick> hi
[2:55:07] <+TvDelta> This looks like 7 days to die
[2:55:11] <%the_oink_man> @Rizzo it was the lud followers who voted to remove
[2:55:15] <agro6996> actual factual
[2:55:20] <+iMinify> You should do more collabs in rl, I personally enjoy them a lot
[2:55:20] <@Primarryy> no oink
[2:55:21] <%navetw> You could possibly make the 3v1 a yt series where you go against other non-RL creators
[2:55:22] <@Primarryy> no no no no
[2:55:26] <%theta5353> @rizzo collab with other people so you can eventually get to ninja
[2:55:28] <ItsApoIIo_> gn everybody, looking forward to friday!
[2:55:30] <agro6996> LULW TRUE
[2:55:31] <%Migos_QTO> yea there are some pretty dry RL streams
[2:55:41] <%the_oink_man> @GrembIo would never stand for this
[2:55:47] <%dynocon> dogJAM
[2:55:50] <+PublicEnemy1010> @Primarryy that's why he made the YouTube, mainly catch the important parts it a good option if you don't have time for sure
[2:55:53] <%MacaMaca> @Sintilla can't accidentally tax evade LULW
[2:55:54] <+foe20> Just craft a fleshlight
[2:55:57] <xShark_RL> Gn
[2:55:58] <%WidThaKid> I only use it for KEKW FART at this point
[2:56:04] <%dynocon> @foe20 fr fr
[2:56:06] <MaelstromDrift> You on a creator server or just a friend server?
