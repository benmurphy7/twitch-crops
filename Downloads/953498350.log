I will keep playing them until they BEG me to stop because their ass is getting whooped so hard. I will be the best damn player in 2 weeks and NO ONE will be able to stop me then. I’m a grinder… so enjoy your victory today and see what happens during our rematch in 2 weeks.

[1:51:27] <phatjosh69> YOU HAVE TO BUILD MYTHIC ITEM FIRST
[1:51:29] <botKevo> Zoe has a sleep bubble and her star does more damage the farther it travels. She can pick up used summoners spells to use for herself for free. She also has a lich bane passive
[1:51:29] <boomlizzard> the sleep also goes through walls and gets a rnage extension for every wall it goes through...
[1:51:30] <+Azkaz_d> from either you if you use them

[3:05:40] <penguinking675> a mythic item buffs your legendary items
[3:05:42] <botKevo> They're stronger starting items

[3:05:47] <%quasarface> maybe spend 10 min to review items :)
[3:05:53] <+ssbmomelette> @Atrioc every item after your mythic gets bonus stats from the mythic. They're super important. You're basically constantly way behind everyone from not building one
[3:05:56] <CarlRaeJepsen> don't you need to build AP before lich bane
[3:05:57] <%mini_delta3445> @Atrioc buffs other full items
