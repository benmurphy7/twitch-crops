[0:10:20] <%swiggymonker> I think cooked is a big deal, but pancakes are fluffier so idk
[0:10:23] <%nate_l1> how u cook it
[0:10:24] <%soccerstar796> the same it is just a different shape and food delivery
[0:10:24] <johnjohn_28> Rizzo content see with a bunch of 7 plats which one learns to ceiling shot first
[0:10:25] <%ThaRealess> just the way they are cooked i think
[0:10:26] <%kevlaxrl> i aint no chef
[0:10:27] <%lemonshark> i think its the dough and vanilla
[0:10:27] <chungusricc> all I know is that you're not my dad
[0:10:28] <+flankinbacon> honestly its the same shit just how you cook it
[0:10:31] <%Saltybeans02> thats like a online class OMEGALUL
[0:10:31] <%WidThaKid> uhhhh so back to the athena flick
[0:10:32] <gopher135> waffle have square
[0:10:33] <+krosthegod> THEY ARE THE SAME BUT WAFFLES GOT THEM ABS
[0:10:35] <%hunter_benn21> waffles are crispy boys and i put baking soda in
[0:10:39] <+Goldberg33> waffles are made with squares
[0:10:40] <%ludgayte> PepoG it seems pancakes and waffles both have no cum in them
[0:10:40] <+flankinbacon> not really lmao
[0:10:41] <%lemonshark> waffle
[0:10:41] <%Neil_182> Egg content and vanilla essense in a waffle
[0:10:42] <%WidThaKid> both
[0:10:43] <%HootieHoo114> The way they are cooked
[0:10:44] <BrettskiiM> Unlike their waffle counterpart, pancakes are lighter and fluffier. Waffles tend to be heavier overall because they are made to be thicker while pancakes are made to be light and fluffy. Pancakes are typically made in round shapes but you can actually make them in whatever shape you want.
[0:10:47] <+WillFoster> waffles are made to be thicker nothings different
[0:10:49] <flameguard23> Pancakes > Wallfe all day unless youre a pus
[0:10:50] <posingapple6608> Waffles are pancakes with abs
[0:10:51] <%lesatgz> i put pancakes in the waffel maker and i see no difference
[0:10:52] <%kevlaxrl> on flicks do u hold jump longer than usual
[0:10:52] <%WidThaKid> just the cooking really
[0:10:53] <hroonk> Waffles are better
[0:10:54] <%darkhorse_23> more sugar according to google. Sounds like Kapp tho
[0:10:55] <+flankinbacon> its just how its cooked these peeps are cappin
[0:10:55] <%hokage_fade> Homemade pancakes > home made waffles
[0:10:55] <+tinytuna55> Egg is egg and egg is cool

[1:47:15] <ka1ebrl> earnings check?
[1:47:21] <+yamixrem> @xauxxmonster yea thats absolute nonsense. when you are on the right wall and jump, right air roll is the faster way to face the ball, ergo left wall -> left roll
[1:47:21] <+bigboppingtonn> no its that monstrosity (here on referred to as "Little Timmy") wants to show his friends that hes super cool and he has G2 RIZZO ON HIS friendslist. So naturally Little Timmy asks for a friend req
[1:47:22] <%Dkarst_11> I FINALLY MADE HIM LAUGH

[1:48:09] <+yamixrem> pros literally depend on 0.02secs to be faster, no way anyone could do a full left air roll around your entire car, instead of just doing a slight touch on right roll
[1:48:15] <$rockyankee1> @bigboppingtonn oh gotcha little timmy has been harassing him?
