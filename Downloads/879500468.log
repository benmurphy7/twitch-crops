[0:17:56] <%lvndrleo> ?? how
[0:17:58] <%DrewThePenguin> Probably Twitch Music
[0:17:59] <+darduel217> Loophole
[0:17:59] <%Forrest2939> Hikaru is so big brain
[0:18:00] <%Jiddy37> 3rd party type thing?
[0:18:00] <%Yaystuffy> The OBS beta I think, you can have multiple audio streams, and only one gets saved to the VOD
[0:18:01] <PastaMystic> !dmca
[0:18:02] <+Stormshadow8200> It’s something in obs
[0:18:05] <%burnin_bright> oooh i think it's a beta version of obs thing?
[0:18:06] <+AuroxaZurlon> isn't that what devin uses as well, his vods are silent
[0:18:06] <+Omey3000> what percentag of people actually watch VODs though?
[0:18:07] <epicnarwhal122> i saw that on tik tok lol
[0:18:08] <%yourfriendqt> !DMCA
[0:18:09] <$StriderH1ryu> ST Peach was talking about something like that
[0:18:10] <+Haze3e> bigbrain
[0:18:11] <BryceEnglert212> I edit for a smaller streamer that can play music on stream that doesn’t show up in his recordings for YouTube
[0:18:12] <just_a_wafflle> PogUDo it
[0:18:12] <jell0o0> Pog do it
[0:18:12] <%Tuwarz> yeah it's a beta OBS
[0:18:13] <%lvndrleo> last time obs didn't work at all
[0:18:15] <%MagoBerry> @QTCinderella i think twitch added the obs thing so it plays to the stream but doesnt record? idk if it stops dmca claims but i think it might?
[0:18:15] <xpinkxdragonx> do u play chess?
[0:18:16] <+thegarden04> Switch!!!!
[0:18:16] <fusion_x> also the vod frogs could be annoyed at not hearing music
[0:18:17] <%DrewThePenguin> StreamLabs is an extension of OBS
[0:18:17] <Rility> hiiiiiiii
[0:18:17] <%Sparzza> dmca can be a banned phrase
[0:18:18] <%cptDonnelly> true he's always playing red hot chilli peppers and I didn't know how he got away with it
[0:18:19] <%lambsaucetv> probably a digital soundboard?
[0:18:19] <BryceEnglert212> I can ask him how he does it
[0:18:20] <%Yaystuffy> Leffen uses it, it's pretty cool
[0:18:24] <+leftist_tears_> Damn I should asleep, FeelsWierdMan
[0:18:24] <%lmrangeljr> didn't micheal revees program something like that?
[0:18:24] <%ComeHelpCasey> Yeah he disables the music in the VOD
[0:18:25] <+Vossier5> like imagine good charlotte... if you can paint them you will do it for them as well
[0:18:25] <%ZemzuTV> i would switch, i can't live without my music LUL
[0:18:25] <@mare_branza> dmca it's like ymca but not as fun
[0:18:27] <PastaMystic> poor vod frogs listening in silence
[0:18:27] <OCalm> poor vod frogs Sadge
[0:18:29] <Peanutz996> I've seen some melee players do that in obs too, pretty sick
[0:18:29] <+Cinister3> another streamer I watch plays DMCA music on stream but puts vods on a custom website, and can somehow filter out music for youtube
[0:18:31] <%thrillho182> I imagine your only risk then would be when/if they start up with the live DMCA shit
[0:18:31] <obliv3ous> you could make it so every time someone types dmca, nightbot responds instead of a command
[0:18:33] <drpufferfish> what are your thoughts on Good Charlotte's "lifestyle of the rich and famous" song effectively being a copy of the melody from the Meat Puppets song "Backwater" ?
[0:18:35] <%MagoBerry> @QTCinderella ik slabs said it either works or there is a extension for it
[0:18:35] <chris05210> thats true i was watching earlier bumping dynamite
[0:18:35] <fusion_x> Live DMCAs are also a thing too, it's not without risk
[0:18:36] <RayTPKC> Worth it for the 🎶
[0:18:38] <@mare_branza> dmca it's like ymca except you can't play ymca KEKWait
[0:18:39] <+twooofspades> i heard something about them doing live dmca notices soon though, like youd get a warning on stream or something
[0:18:39] <jell0o0> that sounds cool
[0:18:39] <texcc> Hey QT and Chat!!!
[0:18:39] <cookiesandqueeen> QT whats your fave GC song
[0:18:42] <QuackstheRubberDuck> i think there's a pluggin that connects to your spotify and i basically jsut links anyone in chat to the same playlist
[0:18:45] <%NotAnotherTyler> That's some fancy stuff right there
[0:18:45] <contrapts> upload vods onto youtube? kinda a pain tho
[0:18:46] <%hxckedIRL> oooo loopholes
[0:18:47] <%jessdesiderio> its a setting in obs :)
[0:18:47] <+bambooplants> when is the next bake along stream??
[0:18:48] <%just__kennedy> pepeSmoke
[0:18:49] <+Kefka1346> Mango does it too
[0:18:50] <52208ireland> Hi
[0:18:50] <+MotionDesign> The license that Twitch has allows for the performance of the music, not the recording of the audio - so clips and VODs need to be turned off
[0:18:52] <just_a_wafflle> That seems sick
[0:18:52] <+antihero301> I watch Vod’s daphCry daphCry daphCry
[0:18:54] <frijolito_bean> pepeSmoke I watch vods for events that I miss like podcast
[0:18:55] <%Forrest2939> I picked up smoking because this stream can't play dancing queen anymore pepeSmoke
[0:18:57] <Rility> the ts album stream is sooooo chill
[0:18:57] <writhingwormpile> obs has a secondary "music" track which does not save to vod
[0:18:57] <jell0o0> PepoG
[0:19:00] <%MagoBerry> normal obs
[0:19:02] <imbryce34> Yeah, it still feels pretty risky though
[0:19:03] <+darduel217> I always wondered how Hikaru got to listen to all that music, I just assumed he didn't fear DMCA
[0:19:06] <%simondub95> Levy probably knows too. He plays music too
[0:19:06] <+Caobistv> @lmrangeljr He wanted to make something that was on both ends like a plug-in but didn’t get it made yet or abounded it
[0:19:07] <%jessdesiderio> regular obs, streamlabs doesnt have it
[0:19:07] <rayccioli> how does that even work thats cool tho
[0:19:07] <%pickle_sawyer> I beg of u to buy croc highheels
[0:19:08] <Rility> normal obs for now

[0:19:15] <fusion_x> It could backfire still
[0:19:15] <jymmiedean> they have a live system though right? all this is so confusing

[0:20:08] <NotLikeTheSinger> What it do QT
[0:20:10] <+twooofspades> @sharksleeve24 technically no, but it's hard to be dmca'd live. people only get dmca strikes through the vods that are saved
[0:20:12] <pappiti> @chloebui cause they make it to make money
[0:20:13] <her_vajestyssecretcervix> hi qt!
[0:20:14] <%Yaystuffy> sharksleeve24, it's technically not allowed for either, but the DMCA scrubbing that Twitch does is for VODs. A copyright holder would have to catch someone in the act to strike them if they're live.

[0:58:22] <Netizpossibleyt> @ExExGirlfriend peepoHey
[0:58:24] <%burnin_bright> yeah music is so gatekeeping
[0:58:30] <+DecayMedia> The idea that this only applies to women is kinda naive. People in general get made fun of for either liking or not liking a thing. If you don't like normally masculine things as a guy, for example, you're less of a man. If you like feminine things, you're less of a man. Trolls abound. They hit everyone.
[0:58:31] <+JobuSenpai> classical music?

[1:36:07] <bananabread422> Working out is not the best way to lose weight. You must have a caloric deficit which is only possible by eating less and exercise. Cardio is the best for this but it can also seem kinda boring, you should try to find some fun way of doing cardio like mini triathlons or bike rides etc.

[1:46:55] <%kas1290> miko's ban might be for the chest writing. People try to make it look like nipples. It's gotten more controlled but some still slip through and twitch probably doesn't like it
[1:46:57] <%tonytigre> NODDERS
[1:46:58] <Netizpossibleyt> @abaftfish peepoHey ppParty

[1:47:19] <%adamcolas> i don't think there's any point speculating on reason for ban. it's just gonna become rumors.
[1:47:20] <%bobbieinabox> @ochogringo i was asking which one not saying ..
[1:47:23] <+Magadido> Are you making forty of these?
[1:47:25] <FartBooty> is there a Michaels art store near you
[1:47:26] <Netizpossibleyt> Yeah the chest writing might be the issue.
[1:47:30] <jsmoth> cute hair

[1:47:34] <MokeyJohn> Does miko still have a non-twitch job/income?

[1:47:36] <@StreamElements> IronChi3f117 just subscribed for 20 months in a row @QTCinderella
[1:47:43] <Netizpossibleyt> Twitch will ban anything if it looks like a boob, but then again there are some people.
[1:47:56] <+Magadido> Are you making forty of these?
[1:47:57] <theoneweirdgirl_> what's your pronouns?
[1:47:59] <FartBooty> agreed thanks for the distraction
[1:48:07] <+WillBeFine> can't see anything relating to ban information on Miko?

[1:49:06] <jsmoth> your hair looks really nice
[1:49:06] <effeknecht> @DrewThePenguin what was the last ban? I thought she only had one so far
[1:49:07] <RandomDudeAf> it's not becuz of the furry sex doll that it get banned?
[1:49:07] <MokeyJohn> From twitch's perpective: they have so much on the line, and they have so many young people watching, they have to be super careful
[1:49:09] <%ithinkitsautumn_> ithinkitsautumn_ subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:49:10] <+WillBeFine> Does anyone know the real reason why Miko was banned?
